# Project Overview


## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

the game will start on the main menu where the player will see the title have the option to start right away or look at the tutorial. One they press start they’ll be taken to the player creator where they can set the difficulty and choose the shape color and name their player. Once the game actually starts the player will see his avatar at the bottom center of the screen and will see a three second countdown to get them ready. after the timer runs out the players score will start going up based on how long they can avoid the falling blocks. The player has three lives and the game will end once all three lives are lost by the player colliding with one of the blocks three times. Next, the player will see their final score and the highest score so far. They will also have the option to change difficulty and try again or just go back the the main menu.

## User Stories

User story is a **description** of **objective**, which helps a person to achieve a feature. So that he able to utilize that feature when using software application. User story is a part of Agile development process.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.  

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

MVP and how I plan to solve it:
	I think the biggest problem ill face will be implementing the collision detection and understanding how that works. I plan on watching some instructional videos on the YouTubes. I also plan to make the collision detection my MVP and start with just focusing on getting one block to detect collision with my player model then expand from there implementing the randomly generated blocks that will fall from off the top of the screen. i am also going to hold off on the option to change character shape till the end because I’m pretty sure the collision detection formula differentiates based on the shapes that are colliding. If I can get the basic game working with just one difficulty and the lives system then I will try to add the rest of the features like the scoreboard and pausing features and ability the change shape of your player.
